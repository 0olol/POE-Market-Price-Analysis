# In-depth Analysis 

I want to start by acknowledging that my analysis may be influenced by my own biases and personal experiences. While I've done my best to remain objective, I encourage you to approach my analysis with a critical eye and consider any potential biases I may have.

## Questions to Answer & Hypothesis

- What Currency or Divination card has the best return when given the start date and end date ? <a href="#train-of-thought">[1]</a>
    - **Hypothesis** :  I feel that Divine Orb should be the best investment to make at league start.


- Is Mirror Of Kalandra the best return of interest ? As it is the most expensive item for the first few weeks.
    - **Hypothesis** : It should be over time the best thing to invest into, as it is the most expensive item.  

- What happens if the price suddenly had a price jump, because of a buff ?
    - **Hypothesis** :  Would probably need to remove the Data Set for that league.

## Train of thought
[1] : 

Original Question : "What is the best thing to invest in to get the highest return ?" 

Too vague, POE has too many factors like 6 - link that is worth at league start. There is also another question: when is your start or end date ?
