Extracting Info and displaying in a nice format for analysis.

I want to be able to know what to invest in which game currency or divination card, currently, for the best profit within the time frame I give the program.

    - So program constraints are only for currency, divination or scarab.
    - The investment is for the dayâ€™s decision. (Or whenever I run it)
    - Being able to choose how long my investment stays inside. (Or rather setting a time frame for me to withdraw and purchase my item)


Do I want to make a website for it ?
    - Yes, React Spring Boot
    - No, Python for faster analysis, and if i want it fast 
How updated is the information I want to make  ?
    - Very, need to run a bot to keep extracting info to compare with my own DB
    - Whenever I run, will have to wait for the data to extract the information
    - Not at all, means I plan on deciding which item i want to take out from it.
Currency or divination card to be prioritized on. (Top few choices)

    - Mirror Cards
        - 1 Mirror = 9 House of mirrors (value = 1/9 each, 0.111)(done)
        - 1 House of mirrors = 10 The Immortal (value = 1/90 each, 0.011)
        - 1 Mirror = 20 Mirror shard (value = 1/20 each, 0.05)
        - 1 Mirror shard = 13 Seven Years Bad Luck (value = 1/260 each, 0.0038 )
        - 19 Mirror Shard = 16 Unrequited Love (value = 19/320 each, 0.059)

Ten Simple Rules:
1) Know your audience
2) Identify your message
3) Adapt the figure
4) Captions are not optional 
5) DO not trust the defaults
6) Use color effectively
7) Do not mislead the reader
8) Avoid "chartJunk"
9) Message trumps beauty 
10) Get the right Tool

Overall To-Do List:
Extracting the data. 
    - Python 
    - Or using java. Plain Java ? Sounds boring but what i have to do. 
    - Being able to layer over multiple league worth of data over each other. 
    - A time Stamp thing to take into account, how long the period is for each dataSet.
    - DL each league and extracting only Divine for now.(Divine only for 2 leagues though) 
    - Maybe do mirror card, cause i forget how much mageblood is.

Things I learn about this project and to do more research and testing.
    - The number of columns might not be even. So find a way to calulate the cut off point, probably not by date but by the id. 
    - there is some outlier .... 
    - Get one to show a chart first lor.
    - Reggression analysis, finding a common dependent variable.
        - In this case, looking at date with the common reference. 
    - Pandas.DataFrame.Expanding
        - Function inside a dataframe(similar to lambda)
    - 

Steps to Analyse the data:
    - Come out a hypothesis
    - Plotting the data to see whether your data is inline with your hypothesis
        - Come out another hypothesis if your data doesnt support it
    - Plotting the graph to find any outlier    
        - With 2 valid variable
    - Find the percentage change between each data points 
    - Find the slope and the plateau, if any.
    - Cut off the data point if need be, catogorising the data into certain time period.
    

Mistakes i made: 
- I forget to plot the graph with mirror shard only 
    - Double check whether data displayed is data you want. 
- 

Things to do:
    - Extracting out the mirror shard column for Kalandra dataSet.(done)
    - Changing all the dates to reference to number of days from leagueStart, 
    so that we maybe able to stack on another dataSet.(done)
    - Changing the Graph to display percentage increase
        - From the previous day(done)
        - With reference to the first day.(done)
    - Having the mean of the 4 dataSet displayed out.
        - Mostly for pct_change, to see the mean of the increase.  
    - 

Things i changed:
- Changed the graph to contain only mirrorShard info
- adding a new column 'days' depending on dates to be able to layer on another graph
- reseting the index and then dropping the index column (done)
    ~ But i realised that this does not do anything for more insights.
    ~ Its mostly used to showcase that I could use a new reference index, easier to count also.
- trying out pct_change, which is a reference to a value to the previous row. 
- cannot see the minor changed without clearing the dirty data, which is <65c
- find another way to not include the drastic drop but yet retain the day with it.
	- Maybe like for more than 20% increase replace the value with 0. 
~ what we can also do is to have 2 different variable for different graph plotting. For the Integer value for mirror shard we remove the odd values out.
~ whereas for the percentage change we replace the percentage change from negative to positive.
! But cannot what, cause the next positive will jump dam high sia. (Then maybe we need to remove extreme cases of both high and low.)

- Find the way formula for percentage change, depending on the changing of days.(manually for now) (done)
- Apparantely if both axis from different variable have the same number of rows we can still plot the graph. 
- Mirrorshard for sentinel is not working cause the days has already been added in somewhere which i didnt remove. 
  Now i have to see where did i add the days column.(done)
    ~ probably from shallow copy of the previous variable. 
- Added 4 dataSet layering over one another for both Integer and pct_change.
- Learned and readup on Mean, Harmonic and Geometric Mean.
    - Not applicable for this as not possible to do it with a 0 value dataPoint for pct_change
    - Also this mean does not give me insights on my original goal. 
- From the graph pct_change i only know
    - That Day 6 will have a 20-30% increase 
    - That Day 10 will have a 10-30% increase
    - Need more research to take alook or support this data. 
    - and to explain it. 
- Tried the percentage change with reference to the first day.
    - The graph came out the same as the original graph with y = value and x = days 
    - As the algorithm that i used is basically normalizing without reducing the value 
- Ultimatium League is the worst case dataSet for Mirror, Mirrorshard 
    - As it is a corruption league, which means that you cannot mirror items and people would rather invest into good rares to corrupt
    - Meaning that the increases was the worst. 
    - Have to double check the other items, but(nvm i will do all the sheets first then i go find how to automate this)
- From the data, it shows that when Archnemesis Tailoring and Tempering Orb is lower than 30c, you will have a huge profit margin. So when it is lower than 30c just buy on league start
Use the percentage graph to measure the stepness to stop the calculation for slope. 
- Had a part where i drop the first few value, but this means im missing it, overall dropping the dataset after testing would be the best effect.


Then what compare how step the slope is ? 
This is all past data, doesn't mean I can get insights from it. 
No past data also got insights one
Need to try combining all the percentage into one line, leaving a few league dataSet out. 
Thinking of placing all into one chunck for better reference

(Done)
Need to look through the divination card results, to look through which league dataSet of the each type of divination card to exclude.
Other than Mirror and Mirror Shard having extra dataSet contain inside compared to the other feel.
HHCard - out
MageBlood - out, Only one card because of release date, and the other one only has 2 leagues worth of data, not worth it.
Mirror - Done remove Kalandra league
Mirror Shard - Prob need to remove the drop Kalandra League
Mirror Card: - Done
House Of Mirror - Seem okay, but just to be sure probably need to remove Archnemesis first day value, and also take a look at expedition dataSet
The Immortal - Need to take a look at the Archnemesis dataSet to see whether need remove the entire thing or just the first point.
Unrequited Love - Looks okay
Seven Years Bad Luck - Looks okay
Secondary Regrading Lens - Too random for data 
Tempering Orb/Tailoring Orb - Done
