Extracting Info and displaying in a nice format for analysis.

I want to be able to know what to invest in which game currency or divination card, currently, for the best profit within the time frame I give the program.

    - So program constraints are only for currency, divination or scarab.
    - The investment is for the dayâ€™s decision. (Or whenever I run it)
    - Being able to choose how long my investment stays inside. (Or rather setting a time frame for me to withdraw and purchase my item)


Do I want to make a website for it ?
    - Yes, React Spring Boot
    - No, Python for faster analysis, and if i want it fast 
How updated is the information I want to make  ?
    - Very, need to run a bot to keep extracting info to compare with my own DB
    - Whenever I run, will have to wait for the data to extract the information
    - Not at all, means I plan on deciding which item i want to take out from it.
Currency or divination card to be prioritized on. (Top few choices)
    - Divine Orb 
    - Tailoring Orb 
    - Tempering Orb 
    - Secondary Regreding Lens 
    - HeadHunter(HH) Cards
    - MageBlood(MB) Cards
    - Mirror Shard, Mirror Cards

Ten Simple Rules:
1) Know your audience
2) Identify your message
3) Adapt the figure
4) Captions are not optional 
5) DO not trust the defaults
6) Use color effectively
7) Do not mislead the reader
8) Avoid "chartJunk"
9) Message trumps beauty 
10) Get the right Tool

Overall To-Do List:
Extracting the data. 
    - Python 
    - Or using java. Plain Java ? Sounds boring but what i have to do. 
    - Being able to layer over multiple league worth of data over each other. 
    - A time Stamp thing to take into account, how longb the period is for each dataset.
    - DL each league and extracting only Divine for now.(Divine only for 2 leagues though) 
    - Maybe do mirror card, cause i forget how much mageblood is.

Extracting out the mirror shard column for Kalandra dataSet.

Things I learn about this project and to do more research and testing.
    - The number of columns might not be even. So find a way to calulate the cut off point, probably not by date but by the id. 
    - there is some outlier .... 
    - Get one to show a chart first lor.

Mistakes i made: 
- I forget to plot the graph with mirror shard only 
    - Double check whether data displayed is data you want. 
- 

Things to do:
    - Changing all the dates to reference to number of days from leagueStart, 
    so that we maybe able to stack on another dataSet.
    - Changing the Graph to display percentage increase
        - From the previous day
        - With reference to the first day.

Things i changed:
- Changed the graph to contain only mirrorShard info
- adding a new column 'days' depending on dates to be able to layer on another graph
- reseting the index and then dropping the index column
- trying out pct_change, which is a reference to a value to the previous row. 
- cannot see the minor changed without clearing the dirty data, which is <65c
- find another way to not include the drastic drop but yet retain the day with it.
	- Maybe like for more than 20% increase replace the value with 0. 
~ what we can also do is to have 2 different variable for different graph plotting. For the Interger value for mirror shard we remove the odd values out.
~ whereas for the percentage change we replace the percentage change from negative to positive.
! But cannot what, cause the next positive will jump dam high sia. (Then maybe we need to remove extreme cases of both high and low.)

- Find the way formula for percentage change, depending on the changing of days.(manually for now) 
- Apparantely if both axis from different variable have the same number of rows we can still plot the graph. 
- mirrorshard for sentienl is not working cause the days has already been added in somewhere which i didnt remove. Now i have to see which place i had place for it 



Can i get the new names out, Naming convention sucks
